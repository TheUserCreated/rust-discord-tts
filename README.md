# rust-discord-tts


im trying to remake my python-discord-tts bot in rust in an effort to learn rust, this one has the same very basic functionality thus far but thats it

much of the code is taken almost straight from the serenity voice bot example, and i honestly dont see the point in changing that since its rather well written, but i will be removing the unneeded parts once this is a little more polished
